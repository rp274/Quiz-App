# Quiz-App
Objective:
Build an interactive quiz web app from scratch.

Requirements:
  - The starting screen should have a button that users can click to start the quiz.
  - Users should be prompted through a series of at least 5 multiple choice questions that they can answer.
  - Users should be asked questions 1 after the other.
  - Users should only be prompted with 1 question at a time.
  - Users should not be able to skip questions.
  - Users should also be able to see which question they're on (for instance, "7 out of 10") and their current score ("5 correct, 2           incorrect").
  - Upon submitting an answer, users should:
    1. receive textual feedback about their answer. If they were incorrect, they should be told the correct answer.
    2. be moved onto the next question (or interact with an element to move on).
  - Users should be shown their overall score at the end of the quiz. In other words, how many questions they got right out of the total       questions asked.
- Users should be able to start a new quiz.

Technologies used:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
  - JQuery

Challenges:
  - Throughout this project I overcame a few challenges in the design and implementation of this project. The first was picking a topic for the quiz, often times trying to come up with a free form topic for a project can be difficult as there are few restrictions. Having a design background I thought I would use this as a method to show off this knowledge through the quiz. I also had to make sure the project followed the a11y requirements which I was able to do so by using a `<form>` element to hold the quiz questions and answer options. Finally the biggest challenge I had was displaying dynamic progression tracker for the quiz. I started off with a quick fix for this but the result was a large section of repetitive code. I will be revisiting this project to refactor and improve the code I have written thus far.
  
  - It was very rewarding to build this as my first "from scratch" project and I am happy with the results but will continue to revisit this and improve upon it.
